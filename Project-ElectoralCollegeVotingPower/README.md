# Electoral College Voting Power Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the voting power of each state in the United States based on the Electoral College system. The purpose is to highlight the discrepancies in voting power depending on the state in which a voter resides, demonstrating how this system contradicts the philosophy of "one person, one vote."

## Project Objectives

- **Quantify Voting Power**: Calculate the voting power of each state's citizens based on their electoral votes and population.
- **Visualize Discrepancies**: Create visualizations to clearly illustrate the differences in voting power among states.
- **Discuss Implications**: Provide an analysis of how these discrepancies impact democratic principles and election outcomes.

## Dataset

### Sources
- **Population Data**: [United States Census Bureau](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2020-2023/state/totals/NST-EST2023-ALLDATA.csv)
- **Electoral Votes**: [National Archives and Records Administration](https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/allocation)

### Description
