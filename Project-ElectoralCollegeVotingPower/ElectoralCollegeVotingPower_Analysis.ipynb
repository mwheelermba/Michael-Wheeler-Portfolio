The goal is to highlight the discrepancies in voting power depending on the state in which a voter resides, demonstrating how this system contradicts the philosophy of \"one person, one vote.\"\n",

    "- Visualize the differences in voting power among states.\n",

Each state has a label showing its number of electoral votes per million people. When hovered, it provides additional text explaining this. When the state itself is hovered over (not the label), details about the state's population, number of electoral votes, and the percentage above or below the national average are displayed.\n",

For example, Wyoming provides 5.14 electoral votes per million people (137% above the average), whereas Texas provides 1.31 electoral votes per million people (33.6% below the average). There is an observable pattern where state population and voting power are inversely related. California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Florida are amongst the highest populations with the lowest voting power. This is not always the case, and is more apparent where population is much higher or lower than the average.\n",

    "## Final Note\n",
    "The Electoral College was originally established to ensure that presidential candidates represented the interests of states with smaller populations, preventing them from being overshadowed by more populous states. This system allocates a fixed number of electoral votes to each state, based on its representation in Congress (the sum of its Senators and Representatives). However, this arrangement has significant implications for the principle of \"one person, one vote.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent presidential elections, there have been instances where the candidate who won the popular vote did not win the presidency due to the distribution of electoral votes. This discrepancy highlights how the voting power of individuals can vary greatly depending on the state in which they reside. For example, a vote in a smaller state like Wyoming carries more weight in the Electoral College than a vote in a larger state like California. This uneven distribution of voting power raises questions about the fairness and democratic nature of the Electoral College system, as it can lead to election outcomes that do not reflect the popular will of the nation.\n",
