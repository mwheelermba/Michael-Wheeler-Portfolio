# Project - Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data

This project is part of the IBM Data Analyst profession certification track. The objective is to use multiple methods to extract stock data. I used Pandas read_html, BeautifulSoup, and the yfinance package, although I only loaded data with BeautifulSoup and did not analyze the data with it.

## Tasks:
* Define Graphing Function
* Use yfinance to Extract Tesla Stock Data
* Use Webscraping to Extract Tesla Revenue Data
* Use yfinance to Extract GameStop Stock Data
* Use Webscraping to Extract GME Revenue Data
* Plot Tesla Stock Graph
* Plot GameStop Stock Graph
