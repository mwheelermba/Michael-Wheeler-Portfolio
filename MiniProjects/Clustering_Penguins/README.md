# Project: Clustering Antarctic Penguin Species

You have been asked to support a team of researchers who have been collecting data about penguins in Antartica! The data is available in csv-Format as `penguins.csv`

**Origin of this data** : Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

**The dataset consists of 5 columns.**

Column | Description
--- | ---
culmen_length_mm | culmen length (mm)
culmen_depth_mm | culmen depth (mm)
flipper_length_mm | flipper length (mm)
body_mass_g | body mass (g)
sex | penguin sex

Unfortunately, they have not been able to record the species of penguin, but they know that there are **at least three** species that are native to the region: **Adelie**, **Chinstrap**, and **Gentoo**.  Your task is to apply your data science skills to help them identify groups in the dataset!

## Tasks:
Utilize your unsupervised learning skills to clusters in the penguins dataset!
* Import, investigate and pre-process the "penguins.csv" dataset.
* Perform a cluster analysis based on a reasonable number of clusters and collect the average values for the clusters. The output should be a DataFrame named stat_penguins with one row per cluster that shows the mean of the original variables (or columns in "penguins.csv") by cluster. stat_penguins should not include any non-numeric columns.

## Findings:
