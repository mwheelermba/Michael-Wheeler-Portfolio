# Michael Wheeler's Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of data analysis projects that I've created on my own time, typically to explore areas in data that I am most interested in. Although I desire to showcase my skills in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and machine learning modeling, my main focus is to explore topics that I find cool or interesting. Each project includes a detailed Jupyter notebook with the complete analysis and findings.

## About Me

My name is Michael Wheeler, I hold an MBA in Business Analytics from Oregon State University where I graduated in 2023 with a 4.0 GPA. I recently served 3 years as the Director of Analytics at a mid-market technology & fulfillment firm. Although most of my professional work has been characterized as business analysis, strategy, and data-driven decision making, I am seeking to break into the more technical aspects of business analytics and explore data analytics and data scientist as my next profession.
